The first customer lifetime value model was built by the Finance Team to support the company's fundraising efforts. Investors needed to see a credible CLV figure to evaluate unit economics and assess whether the business could scale profitably. The model used a simple formula: average monthly revenue per user multiplied by the estimated average customer lifespan in months. Both inputs were derived from the limited data available at the time, supplemented by assumptions based on comparable companies in the food delivery space.

The team recognized that this initial model was rough and based heavily on assumptions rather than proven retention curves or validated revenue projections. The estimated customer lifespan was particularly uncertain because the product had not been live long enough to observe true long-term retention patterns. Despite these limitations, the v1.0 CLV model served its immediate purpose by providing a defensible starting point for investor conversations and internal planning. The Finance Team flagged this definition for revisiting once enough cohort data had accumulated to build a model grounded in the company's own user behavior rather than industry averages and educated guesses.
