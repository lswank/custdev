The initial definition of churn was established as a leadership decision informed by industry benchmarks. At the time, the team looked at how other consumer apps defined inactive users and settled on a straightforward rule: if a user had not logged in for 30 consecutive days, they were considered churned. This definition was chosen because it was simple to implement, easy to explain to stakeholders, and roughly aligned with what other companies in the mobile app space were using.

The team acknowledged from the start that this was a pragmatic choice rather than a data-driven one. The product was still relatively new, and there was not yet enough historical data to determine what inactivity window truly signaled that a user was gone for good. The 30-day login threshold gave the team a working metric to monitor while the product matured and enough behavioral data accumulated to revisit the definition with a more rigorous, evidence-based approach.
