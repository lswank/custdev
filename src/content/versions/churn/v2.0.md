When the Data Team analyzed user behavior over a six-month period, they discovered a significant flaw in the original churn definition. A large segment of users continued to log in regularly to browse restaurants, check menus, and look at promotions, but they never actually placed an order. Under the v1.0 definition, these users appeared active and healthy because they were logging in. In reality, they were generating zero revenue and showed no signs of becoming paying customers again. The login-based metric was painting a falsely optimistic picture of user retention.

The revised definition shifted the churn signal from logins to orders, and extended the inactivity window from 30 days to 60 days. The Data Team arrived at the 60-day threshold by analyzing ordering frequency distributions and identifying the point beyond which the probability of a user placing another order dropped below five percent. This change meant that a user who logged in every week to browse but had not ordered in two months would now correctly be classified as churned. The new definition aligned the churn metric with actual business value and gave the retention team a more accurate foundation for designing win-back campaigns and measuring their effectiveness.
