This was the first attempt at defining what activation means for the product. At the time, the team equated activation with account creation because it was the most visible and easily measurable event in the user journey. When someone signed up, the assumption was that they had taken a meaningful step toward becoming an engaged user. This assumption felt intuitive and aligned with how many early-stage companies think about growth: get people through the door, and the rest will follow.

The discovery interviews that prompted this definition revealed that most stakeholders internally thought of "activated users" as anyone who had created an account. There was no distinction between someone who signed up and never returned and someone who signed up and immediately placed an order. The team recognized this was a starting point that would need refinement, but it served as a baseline for initial reporting and gave everyone a shared vocabulary to work from while the product was still in its early stages.
