The Data Team conducted a thorough retention analysis comparing users who merely created accounts against those who completed various early actions within different time windows. The results were unambiguous: account creation alone had virtually no predictive power for long-term retention. A user who signed up but never placed an order was almost as likely to disappear as someone who never signed up at all. In contrast, users who completed their first order within seven days of signing up showed dramatically higher 30-day and 90-day retention rates.

This finding forced the team to abandon the original v1.0 definition and adopt a more meaningful measure of activation. The new definition, completing a first order within seven days of account creation, directly tied activation to the moment a user experienced the core value of the product. This change had significant downstream effects: the reported activation rate dropped substantially, but it now reflected genuine engagement rather than superficial sign-ups. The Product Team used this revised metric to redesign the onboarding flow with a focus on driving users toward their first order as quickly as possible, and the Data Team built dashboards to track the seven-day activation window in real time.
