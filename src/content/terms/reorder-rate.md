## Overview

Reorder rate is the percentage of customers who come back and place another order after their first one. If 100 people order from QuickBite for the first time in January and 40 of them order again within the next 30 days, the 30-day reorder rate is 40%. It is one of the simplest and most powerful ways to measure whether customers liked their experience enough to return.

QuickBite tracks reorder rate across different time windows. A 7-day reorder rate shows how many customers come back almost immediately, which often signals a great first experience. A 30-day rate captures customers who may only order on weekends or paydays. A 90-day rate gives a longer view that accounts for more casual users. Each window tells a slightly different story about customer behavior.

During validation, the team pays close attention to reorder rate because it answers a fundamental question: does QuickBite deliver enough value to bring people back? If the reorder rate is low, it does not matter how many new users the team attracts. They will all leave. A healthy reorder rate proves that the core experience, from browsing to delivery, actually works.

## Why This Matters

Reorder rate is a direct measure of customer satisfaction that shows up in real behavior, not just survey answers. A customer might tell you they liked the app, but if they never order again, something went wrong. Watching the reorder rate over time helps QuickBite separate what people say from what they actually do.

This metric also has a huge impact on growth. A high reorder rate means every dollar spent on acquiring a new customer pays off multiple times because that customer keeps coming back. QuickBite can experiment with things like faster delivery, better packaging, or personalized restaurant recommendations, and then check whether the reorder rate improves. If a change lifts the reorder rate even by a few percentage points, it compounds over thousands of customers and leads to meaningful revenue growth.
