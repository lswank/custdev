## Overview

Order frequency measures how often a customer places an order on QuickBite over a given period of time. If a customer orders three times in a month, their monthly order frequency is three. This number helps QuickBite understand how engaged its customers are and how much revenue it can expect from them.

QuickBite tracks order frequency at both the individual and group level. On an individual level, it helps identify power users who order almost every day versus casual users who order once a month. At the group level, the team looks at average order frequency across all customers in a market to gauge overall health. A rising average means customers are finding more reasons to use the app. A falling average is a warning sign.

During validation, the QuickBite team tests whether customers in a new market will order often enough to make the business work. They might run a pilot in a small neighborhood and measure how often early users come back. If the average user only orders once and never returns, the team knows something needs to change before scaling up.

## Why This Matters

Order frequency is one of the strongest signals of product-market fit for QuickBite. A customer who orders once might have been curious. A customer who orders every week genuinely relies on the service. High order frequency means customers see QuickBite as a regular part of their routine, not just a novelty.

From a business standpoint, increasing order frequency is often easier and cheaper than finding new customers. QuickBite can boost frequency by suggesting meals at lunchtime to users who usually only order dinner, by offering a loyalty program that rewards repeat orders, or by adding new restaurant choices that give people more reasons to open the app. Even a small bump in average frequency across thousands of customers can significantly increase total revenue.
