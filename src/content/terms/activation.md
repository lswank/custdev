## Overview

Activation is the moment a new user gets real value from QuickBite for the first time. This usually means they have signed up, browsed restaurants, placed their first order, and received their food. Until that happens, they are just someone who downloaded the app. After activation, they become a real customer who understands what QuickBite can do for them.

Think of it like trying a new restaurant. You might walk past it every day, but you do not really know if you like it until you sit down and eat a meal. In the same way, a person who downloads QuickBite but never orders food has not been activated. The goal is to move every new user from "just browsing" to "I got my food and it was great" as quickly as possible.

Activation is not the same as just signing up. A user who creates an account but never places an order has not been activated. QuickBite tracks activation by looking at whether a user completes their first delivery within a set time window, usually the first seven days after signing up.

## Why This Matters

If QuickBite cannot activate new users, all the money spent on ads and promotions goes to waste. Imagine spending five dollars to get someone to download the app, only for them to open it once and forget about it. That five dollars is lost. But if that person places an order and has a good experience, they are likely to come back and order again, making that initial cost worth it.

Tracking activation also helps the team figure out where users get stuck. For example, if many people add food to their cart but never check out, the checkout process might be confusing. If people place an order but never come back, maybe the delivery was too slow. By measuring activation carefully, QuickBite can find and fix the problems that stop new users from becoming loyal customers.
