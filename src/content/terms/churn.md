## Overview

Churn is when a customer stops using QuickBite. If someone used to order food every week but has not placed an order in the last 60 days, QuickBite might consider that person churned. They have left, and unless the team does something to bring them back, they are gone for good.

Churn is measured as a percentage. If QuickBite had 10,000 active customers at the start of the month and 500 of them stopped ordering by the end, the monthly churn rate would be 5%. A high churn rate means the company is losing customers faster than it can replace them, which is a serious problem for any business.

There are different reasons why people churn. Some leave because they had a bad experience, like a late delivery or a wrong order. Others leave because a competitor offered better prices. And some simply move to an area where QuickBite does not deliver. Understanding the reason behind churn helps the team decide what to fix first.

## Why This Matters

Churn directly affects how much money QuickBite makes. It costs much more to find a brand-new customer than to keep an existing one. If the churn rate is too high, the company has to spend more and more on marketing just to stay the same size, let alone grow. Lowering churn by even a small amount can have a big impact on revenue over time.

QuickBite can fight churn by reaching out to customers who seem to be slipping away. For example, if a weekly customer has not ordered in two weeks, the app could send them a push notification with a discount code. The team can also look at patterns in churned customers to spot warning signs early, like a drop in order frequency or a series of bad ratings, and step in before the customer leaves.
