## Overview

The delivery radius is the maximum distance QuickBite will deliver food from a restaurant to a customer. If a restaurant has a delivery radius of five miles, only customers within that five-mile circle can order from it. Anyone outside that range will not see that restaurant in their app.

QuickBite sets delivery radii based on several factors. Drive time matters more than raw distance because a five-mile trip in a suburban area might take ten minutes, while five miles in heavy city traffic could take thirty. The type of food also plays a role. A pizza might travel well over a longer distance, but an ice cream sundae needs to arrive quickly before it melts. Each restaurant's radius is tuned to make sure food arrives in good condition.

During the discovery phase, the QuickBite team studies maps, traffic data, and local road networks to figure out the right delivery radius for each new market. They talk to potential customers to learn how far they expect food delivery to travel and how long they are willing to wait. This research shapes the initial radius before the app even launches in a new city.

## Why This Matters

Getting the delivery radius right is one of the most important decisions QuickBite makes when entering a new area. If the radius is too small, customers see very few restaurant choices and may not find anything they want. If the radius is too large, deliveries take too long, food arrives cold, and customers leave bad reviews.

A well-chosen delivery radius also affects the business side. Longer deliveries cost more because drivers spend more time and fuel on each order. QuickBite needs to balance customer choice with delivery speed and cost. By studying real delivery data and customer feedback, the team can adjust radii over time, expanding them where drivers are fast and shrinking them where food quality suffers.
