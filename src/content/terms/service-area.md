## Overview

A service area is a geographic region where QuickBite operates. It is the boundary on the map that defines where customers can place orders and where drivers are available to make deliveries. When QuickBite launches in a new city, the team draws the service area based on where they have enough partner restaurants and drivers to provide a reliable experience.

Service areas are not always shaped like neat circles or squares. They follow the real layout of a city, hugging neighborhoods with high population density and skipping over industrial zones or areas with very few residents. A service area might cover downtown and the surrounding suburbs but leave out a rural stretch on the outskirts where deliveries would take too long. The boundaries are based on practical factors like drive times, restaurant density, and customer demand.

During the creation phase, defining the service area is one of the first things the QuickBite team does when entering a new market. They analyze census data, restaurant locations, competitor coverage, and traffic patterns to draw boundaries that make business sense. The initial service area often starts smaller than expected, covering only the most promising neighborhoods, and expands over time as the company adds more restaurants and drivers.

## Why This Matters

The service area determines who can use QuickBite and who cannot. Drawing it too small means missing out on potential customers who live just outside the boundary. Drawing it too large means making promises the company cannot keep, like fast delivery in areas where there are not enough drivers. Getting the boundaries right balances opportunity with reliability.

Service area decisions also affect how customers perceive QuickBite. If someone downloads the app and discovers they are outside the service area, they are unlikely to check back later. That is a lost opportunity. On the other hand, if someone inside the service area consistently gets fast, accurate deliveries, they become a loyal customer and spread the word to friends and neighbors. As QuickBite grows, the team regularly reviews service area boundaries, expanding into adjacent neighborhoods once the infrastructure, meaning enough restaurants and drivers, is in place to maintain quality.
