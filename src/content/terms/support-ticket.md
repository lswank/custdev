## Overview

A support ticket is a record created when a QuickBite customer reaches out for help with a problem. This could be a missing item from their order, a delivery that never arrived, a charge they do not recognize, or trouble using the app. Each ticket is logged in QuickBite's support system, assigned to a team member, and tracked until the issue is resolved.

Support tickets follow a lifecycle. When a customer submits one, it starts as "open." A support agent reviews it, investigates the problem, and takes action, like issuing a refund or contacting the restaurant. Once the issue is fixed and the customer is informed, the ticket is marked "resolved." If the customer responds with a follow-up question, the ticket can be reopened. QuickBite measures how long each step takes to make sure customers are not left waiting.

The support team categorizes every ticket by type, such as missing items, late deliveries, payment issues, or app bugs. This categorization helps the team spot trends. If a particular restaurant generates a lot of missing-item tickets, QuickBite can work with that restaurant to improve its order preparation process. If a certain type of bug appears after an app update, the engineering team can prioritize a fix.

## Why This Matters

Support tickets are a goldmine of information about what is going wrong at QuickBite. Every ticket represents a customer who had a bad enough experience to take the time to complain. For every person who writes in, there are likely several more who had the same problem but just stopped using the app instead. Tracking tickets helps the team find and fix issues before they drive even more customers away.

The volume and resolution speed of support tickets also directly affect customer trust. A customer who reports a missing item and gets a refund within ten minutes is likely to forgive the mistake and order again. A customer who waits three days for a response may never come back. QuickBite sets targets for response time and resolution time, and reviews them weekly to make sure the support team is keeping up. Fewer tickets and faster resolutions together signal a healthier, more reliable product.
