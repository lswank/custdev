## Overview

A partner restaurant is any restaurant that has signed an agreement with QuickBite to sell its food through the app. When a customer opens QuickBite and browses their options, every restaurant they see is a partner restaurant. These businesses have agreed to prepare orders placed through the app and have them ready for QuickBite drivers to pick up and deliver.

The relationship between QuickBite and a partner restaurant is a two-way street. QuickBite brings the restaurant extra customers it might not reach on its own, especially people who prefer to eat at home. In return, the restaurant pays QuickBite a commission on each order, usually a percentage of the order total. Both sides benefit when the partnership works well.

During the creation phase, the QuickBite team actively recruits restaurants to join the platform. They look for a good mix of cuisines, price ranges, and brand recognition to make sure customers have plenty of choices. A market with only two pizza places and a burger joint will not feel very appealing, so variety is key when building the initial restaurant lineup.

## Why This Matters

Partner restaurants are the backbone of QuickBite. Without them, there is nothing to deliver. The quality, variety, and reliability of partner restaurants directly shape how customers feel about the app. If a customer's favorite local taco shop is on QuickBite, they are far more likely to keep using the service. If the only options are places they have never heard of, they may lose interest.

Managing restaurant partnerships also takes ongoing effort. QuickBite needs to make sure restaurants keep their menus up to date, prepare food on time, and maintain quality. A single bad experience with a partner restaurant, like receiving the wrong order or waiting an extra thirty minutes, reflects poorly on QuickBite, not just the restaurant. The team works closely with partners to set expectations, share feedback, and resolve problems before they drive customers away.
