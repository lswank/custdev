## Overview

The First Order Experience is everything a new customer goes through from the moment they open QuickBite for the first time to the moment their first delivery arrives at their door. It includes signing up, entering an address, browsing restaurants, choosing items, checking out, tracking the driver, and finally receiving the food. Every step in this journey shapes how the customer feels about QuickBite.

A smooth first order experience means the customer did not hit any confusing screens, did not wait too long, and got exactly what they expected. A rough first order experience means the opposite: maybe the app crashed, the restaurant was out of their chosen item, or the driver got lost. Because people tend to remember first impressions more than anything else, this experience has an outsized effect on whether they ever come back.

During the discovery phase, the QuickBite team interviews potential customers to understand what they expect from a food delivery app the very first time they use one. Researchers watch people try the app for the first time and note where they hesitate, get confused, or give up. These observations guide decisions about how to design the onboarding screens, what information to ask for upfront, and how to set expectations about delivery time.

## Why This Matters

The first order experience is the single biggest factor in whether a new user becomes a repeat customer. Studies across the food delivery industry show that customers who have a bad first experience are five to ten times less likely to order again compared to those who have a good one. For QuickBite, that means getting the first order right is not optional. It is essential.

Investing in the first order experience also saves money in the long run. It is cheaper to keep a customer than to find a new one. If QuickBite nails the first delivery, the customer is likely to order again without any extra marketing spend. But if the first order goes badly, the team has to spend time and money on win-back campaigns, discount codes, and apology emails, and most of those churned customers never return anyway. Getting it right the first time is always the better strategy.
