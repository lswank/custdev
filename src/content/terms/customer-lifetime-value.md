## Overview

Customer Lifetime Value is the total amount of money QuickBite expects to earn from a single customer over the entire time they use the service. If a typical customer orders twice a month, spends fifteen dollars per order, and stays active for two years, their lifetime value is about 720 dollars in revenue. After subtracting costs like delivery fees, driver pay, and restaurant commissions, the profit portion of that number is what really matters.

Calculating lifetime value involves looking at three main inputs: how often a customer orders, how much they spend each time, and how long they stick around before churning. QuickBite does not know exactly how long any one person will stay, so the team uses averages and statistical models based on past customer behavior to make educated estimates.

Lifetime value is not fixed. It changes as QuickBite improves its product. If the team adds a subscription plan that encourages more frequent orders, lifetime value goes up. If delivery times get worse and customers leave sooner, it goes down. The number acts as a scorecard for how well the company is serving its customers over time.

## Why This Matters

Customer Lifetime Value tells QuickBite how much it can afford to spend to acquire a new customer. If the average lifetime value is 200 dollars in profit, spending 50 dollars on marketing to win that customer makes sense. Spending 250 dollars does not. Without knowing lifetime value, the company is guessing about whether its marketing budget is too high, too low, or about right.

This metric also helps QuickBite decide where to invest. If customers in one city have twice the lifetime value of customers in another, the company might prioritize expanding in the higher-value market. Similarly, if a particular customer segment, like families who order large group meals, has an especially high lifetime value, QuickBite can tailor features and promotions to attract more of those customers. It is one of the most important numbers for making smart long-term decisions.
