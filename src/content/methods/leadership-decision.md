## How It Works

A leadership decision is a top-down determination made by the executive team or senior leadership about how a term or metric should be defined. This method is used when strategic alignment matters more than bottom-up data gathering, or when a decision needs to be made quickly to unblock other work. The Executive Team documents the reasoning behind the decision, including what information was considered, what alternatives were evaluated, and what business objectives the chosen definition serves. Leadership decisions are recorded in the wiki with full transparency so the broader team understands the rationale and can revisit the decision as new data becomes available.

## When to Use It

Leadership decisions are appropriate when the team faces time pressure, strategic trade-offs, or organizational alignment challenges that cannot be resolved through data alone. For example, when launching a new market, leadership may need to set initial definitions for key metrics before any local data exists. Leadership decisions are also used when different teams disagree on a definition and a tiebreaker is needed to keep work moving forward. This method should not be the default for routine definitions, but it plays an important role in situations where speed and alignment outweigh the benefits of a slower, data-driven process.

## Confidence Level

Leadership decisions provide a medium level of confidence. They carry the weight of organizational authority and typically incorporate the leaders' accumulated experience, strategic context, and awareness of company priorities. However, they are not based on systematic evidence from the product's own users and data. The medium rating reflects the fact that leadership decisions are usually well-reasoned but may not survive contact with real user behavior. The team should plan to validate leadership-driven definitions through analytics or experimentation within a defined timeframe, and the wiki tracks these definitions separately so they can be revisited when data becomes available.
