## How It Works

Customer interviews are structured one-on-one conversations with real or potential users, designed to uncover their needs, frustrations, and behaviors. The interviewer follows a prepared guide but remains flexible enough to explore unexpected insights. Sessions are typically recorded and transcribed so the team can review exact quotes and identify patterns across multiple conversations. The goal is not to ask users what they want but to understand what they actually do, what problems they face, and how they currently solve them.

## When to Use It

This method is most valuable during the discovery and validation phases of customer development, when the team is trying to understand whether a problem exists and whether a proposed solution resonates. Customer interviews are particularly effective when the team has a hypothesis about user behavior but lacks quantitative data to confirm or deny it. They are also useful when metrics show something unexpected, such as a sudden drop in activation, and the team needs qualitative context to understand why.

## Confidence Level

Customer interviews provide a medium level of confidence. They offer rich, contextual insights that quantitative methods cannot match, but they are inherently limited by small sample sizes and the biases that come with self-reported behavior. Users often say one thing and do another, so interview findings should be treated as strong signals worth investigating further rather than definitive proof. Teams should look to validate interview insights with analytics or A/B tests before making major product decisions based on them alone.
