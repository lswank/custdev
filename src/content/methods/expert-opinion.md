## How It Works

Expert opinion involves consulting individuals with deep domain expertise to inform how a term or metric should be defined. These experts may be internal leaders, external advisors, industry consultants, or academic researchers who have extensive experience in the relevant area. The Advisory Board facilitates these consultations, collecting recommendations and documenting the reasoning behind each expert's perspective. The output is typically a recommended definition along with the expert's rationale, any caveats they noted, and suggestions for how the team should validate the definition with data over time.

## When to Use It

Expert opinion is most appropriate during the early discovery phase, when the team is exploring a new domain and lacks both internal data and established industry benchmarks. It is also useful when the team encounters a highly specialized topic, such as regulatory compliance metrics or advanced statistical methodologies, where domain-specific knowledge is essential to get the definition right. Expert opinions can help the team avoid obvious mistakes and move faster by providing an informed starting hypothesis. However, they should always be treated as a starting point rather than a final answer, with plans in place to validate the opinion through more rigorous methods.

## Confidence Level

Expert opinion provides a low level of confidence in the context of data-driven product development. While individual experts may have decades of experience, their recommendations are inherently subjective and influenced by their own experiences, biases, and the specific contexts they have worked in. Two experts in the same field may give contradictory advice. For this reason, definitions based solely on expert opinion should be flagged for follow-up validation through analytics, customer interviews, or A/B tests. The low confidence rating does not mean the method is without value; rather, it signals that the definition has not yet been tested against the team's own product reality.
