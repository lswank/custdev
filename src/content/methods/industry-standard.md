## How It Works

The industry standard method involves adopting definitions, benchmarks, or best practices that are widely accepted across the industry. The Research Team surveys published reports, competitor analyses, academic papers, and established frameworks to identify how other companies in the same space define and measure key terms. When a strong consensus exists, the team may adopt that definition as a starting point for internal use. The rationale and source materials are documented so the team can trace why a particular standard was chosen and evaluate whether it still applies as the product evolves.

## When to Use It

Industry standards are most useful during the discovery and creation phases of customer development, when the team needs a reasonable starting point but does not yet have enough internal data to derive its own definitions. They are also valuable when communicating with external stakeholders, such as investors or partners, who expect metrics to be calculated in a commonly understood way. For example, when building initial financial models or defining churn for the first time, starting with an industry-accepted definition can save weeks of debate and provide a credible baseline that the team can refine later with its own data.

## Confidence Level

Industry standards provide a medium level of confidence. They represent the collective wisdom of many companies and researchers, which is a strong starting point, but they may not reflect the specific realities of your product, market, or user base. A definition that works well for a mature SaaS company may be misleading for an early-stage food delivery startup. The team should treat industry standards as informed defaults that need to be validated with internal data before being treated as ground truth. Over time, most industry-standard definitions in the wiki get replaced or refined through analytics reviews and A/B tests.
