## How It Works

An analytics review involves examining existing product data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in user behavior. The Data Team queries event logs, transaction records, and engagement metrics to answer specific questions about how users interact with the product. Common analyses include cohort retention curves, funnel conversion rates, feature usage distributions, and correlation studies between early behaviors and long-term outcomes. The results are compiled into reports with visualizations that make the findings accessible to the broader team.

## When to Use It

Analytics reviews are useful at every phase of customer development, but they are especially powerful during the validation phase when the team needs to confirm or challenge assumptions with real behavioral data. They are the right choice when the question can be answered by looking at what users actually did rather than what they say they would do. For example, an analytics review can reveal whether users who complete onboarding within the first day retain better than those who take a week, or whether a specific feature correlates with higher order frequency. This method requires that the relevant events are already being tracked in the product.

## Confidence Level

Analytics reviews provide a high level of confidence because they are based on actual user behavior at scale rather than self-reported preferences or small-sample observations. Unlike interviews, analytics data covers the entire user base and is not subject to recall bias or social desirability effects. However, analytics can show what happened without explaining why. Correlation does not imply causation, so the team must be careful not to draw causal conclusions from observational data alone. For that reason, analytics reviews often pair well with customer interviews for context and A/B tests for causal validation.
