## The Twitter Version

Company Building means turning your proven product into a sustainable, well-run organization.

## What Happens in This Phase

The product works. Customers are coming. Revenue is growing. Now you need to build the company that supports all of this long-term. This is where startup chaos becomes operational discipline.

For QuickBite, this means things like: What happens when a delivery goes wrong? Who handles it? What's the response time target? How do you onboard a new city? What does the first week look like? What metrics does the ops team track daily? Every answer becomes a process. Every process needs an owner. Every owner needs a way to know if things are working.

This phase feels less exciting than the earlier ones. There are no eureka moments in building an employee onboarding checklist. But this is where companies either become real or fall apart. The difference between a startup that stays at 50 employees and one that grows to 500 is almost always operational — can you do the same thing consistently, at scale, without the founders personally handling every edge case?

## You Know You're in This Phase When...

- You're hiring for roles that didn't exist six months ago
- You're writing process docs and SLAs
- Decisions are made by teams, not just founders
- Metrics are tracked in dashboards, not spreadsheets
- New employees need onboarding to understand how things work

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-engineering processes.** You write a 20-page handbook for something that could be a one-page checklist. Keep processes as simple as possible. You can always add complexity later.

2. **Losing the customer voice.** As the company grows, decisions get made further from the customer. The person designing the support ticket workflow has never talked to a frustrated user. Build in regular touchpoints with real customers, even at scale.

3. **Freezing definitions too early.** Just because you're in Company Building doesn't mean your definitions are final forever. Markets change. Customers change. Build in quarterly reviews so your definitions stay current.

## What Wiki Entries Look Like in This Phase

Definitions in Building are tagged with `confidence: canonical`. They include an owner and a review date. They're operational — not just what a term means, but how it's measured, who's responsible, and what happens when the metric moves.

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
custdev_phase: "building"
confidence: "canonical"
method: "analytics"
```

The definition body includes operational details: measurement methodology, responsible team, review schedule, escalation path. Every definition in this phase should be actionable by someone who just joined the company.
