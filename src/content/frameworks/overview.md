## What Is Customer Development?

Customer development is a way to build products that people actually want. Instead of guessing what customers need and building it all at once, you test your ideas step by step. You talk to real people. You measure what they do, not just what they say. And you change direction when the evidence tells you to.

Steve Blank created this framework. It has four phases. Each phase answers a different question. You move through them in order, but you can (and should) go back if you learn something that changes your assumptions.

## The Four Phases

### 1. Customer Discovery
**"Do people actually have this problem?"**

You start by talking to potential customers. You're not selling anything yet. You're listening. You want to find out if the problem you think exists is real, and if people care enough to want it solved.

### 2. Customer Validation
**"Will they pay us to solve it?"**

Now you test whether your solution works. You build the minimum version of your product and see if people will use it — and pay for it. This is where you find out if you have a real business or just a nice idea.

### 3. Customer Creation
**"How do we reach them at scale?"**

You've proven the product works for early customers. Now you figure out how to reach more people like them. This is about marketing, positioning, and channels — how you tell the world what you've built.

### 4. Company Building
**"How do we operationalize this?"**

You've found your market and your customers. Now you build the company to serve them long-term. This means processes, teams, metrics, and all the infrastructure that turns a startup into a sustainable business.

## How This Wiki Uses the Framework

Every term, definition, and method in this wiki is tagged with a customer development phase. This tells you:

- **How confident we are** in the definition (hypotheses in Discovery, proven facts in Building)
- **What kind of evidence** supports it (interviews in Discovery, analytics in Building)
- **How stable it is** (expect frequent changes in Discovery, rare changes in Building)
- **Who should care** (product teams in Discovery, the whole company in Building)

When you read a definition tagged "Discovery," treat it as a working theory. When you read one tagged "Building," treat it as how we actually do things.
