## The Twitter Version

Customer Validation means testing whether people will actually pay for your solution to their problem.

## What Happens in This Phase

You've talked to enough people to believe the problem is real. Now you need to find out if your solution works — and if people will pay for it.

For QuickBite, this means building a basic version of the app and getting real orders. Not a beautiful, feature-complete app. The simplest thing that lets someone order food and receive it. Maybe you start with just 10 restaurants in one neighborhood. Maybe you handle delivery yourself for the first week.

The key question changes from "is this a real problem?" to "will people give us money to solve it?" You track everything. How many people sign up? How many place a first order? How many come back for a second? What's the average order value? Each number tells you whether your solution actually works or just sounded good in interviews.

If the numbers are bad, you don't panic — you pivot. Maybe the delivery model needs to change. Maybe you need a different customer segment. Validation is where you learn whether to keep going, adjust, or try something fundamentally different.

## You Know You're in This Phase When...

- You have a working product (even if it's rough)
- You're measuring user behavior, not just asking opinions
- You're running experiments to test specific hypotheses
- Revenue (or strong intent-to-pay signals) is your north star metric
- You're iterating fast based on data

## Common Mistakes

1. **Vanity metrics.** Celebrating signups when what matters is activation and retention. 1,000 signups mean nothing if only 50 people place an order.

2. **Premature scaling.** Your first 100 users love the product, so you spend $50,000 on marketing. But those first users were hand-picked early adopters — the next 1,000 might not behave the same way.

3. **Ignoring negative data.** Your reorder rate is 15% but you focus on the glowing reviews from the 15%. The 85% who didn't come back are trying to tell you something.

## What Wiki Entries Look Like in This Phase

Definitions in Validation are tagged with `confidence: tested`. They cite specific data: conversion rates, experiment results, cohort analyses. The language shifts from "we think" to "our data shows."

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
custdev_phase: "validation"
confidence: "tested"
method: "ab-test"
```

The definition body includes numbers, sample sizes, and date ranges. It distinguishes between what's been tested and what's still assumed.
