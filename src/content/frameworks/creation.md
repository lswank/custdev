## The Twitter Version

Customer Creation means figuring out how to reach more customers like the ones who already love your product.

## What Happens in This Phase

You've validated the product. Early customers are using it and paying for it. Now you need to find a lot more customers like them — without losing what made the product work in the first place.

For QuickBite, this means expanding beyond your first neighborhood. You need to figure out which channels bring in customers who actually order (not just download the app). Maybe Instagram ads work great but Facebook ads don't. Maybe partnerships with local food bloggers convert better than both. You test channels the same way you tested the product — with real data, not assumptions.

This is also where your messaging gets serious. In Discovery, you described your product to yourself. In Validation, you described it to early adopters who were willing to try rough things. Now you need to describe it to people who have plenty of alternatives and limited attention. Every word in your positioning matters. You're writing for customers, not for your team.

## You Know You're in This Phase When...

- Your product-market fit is confirmed (retention is strong)
- You're focused on growth and acquisition channels
- Marketing spend is a real budget line, not experiments
- You're writing content for customers, not internal docs
- Competitive positioning becomes important

## Common Mistakes

1. **Changing the product for growth.** You add features to attract new segments but break the experience for your core users. Growth comes from reaching more of the right people, not from becoming everything to everyone.

2. **Scaling before the unit economics work.** Getting customers for $30 each when each customer is worth $25 doesn't become profitable at scale. It becomes bankrupt at scale.

3. **Generic messaging.** "Fast, reliable food delivery" describes every food delivery app. Your messaging needs to be specific about what makes you different and who you're different for.

## What Wiki Entries Look Like in This Phase

Definitions in Creation are tagged with `confidence: proven`. They're written from the customer's perspective — how would you explain this to someone considering your product? The language is external-facing and precise.

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
custdev_phase: "creation"
confidence: "proven"
method: "analytics"
```

The definition body focuses on customer impact. Instead of "we define activation as X," it says "a customer is activated when they experience X." Every claim includes the evidence that proved it.
