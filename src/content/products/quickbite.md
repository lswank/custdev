## Overview

QuickBite is a food delivery platform that connects customers with local restaurants. Users browse menus, place orders, and receive delivery within 30-45 minutes. The platform handles the entire flow from discovery to doorstep.

## Current Phase: Customer Validation

QuickBite is in the Customer Validation phase. We've confirmed that people want convenient food delivery (Discovery), and now we're testing whether our specific solution — fast delivery from curated local restaurants — is something they'll pay for repeatedly.

Key validation questions we're answering right now:
- Will users reorder after their first experience?
- What delivery radius keeps both speed and restaurant selection viable?
- Can we reach 3+ orders per active user per month?

## Team

The QuickBite team includes product, engineering, and operations members focused on proving the core delivery model before scaling to new markets.
