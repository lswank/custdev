Activation is the moment when a new user completes the key action that shows they have experienced the core value of your product for the first time. It is not the same as signing up or creating an account. Instead, activation happens when the user does something meaningful that proves the product is working for them. For example, in a project management tool, activation might mean creating a first project and inviting a teammate.

Understanding activation matters because it helps teams figure out whether new users are actually getting value or just passing through. If a lot of people sign up but very few activate, that is a strong signal that something in the onboarding experience needs to change. Teams track activation rates to measure how well they guide users from signup to that first moment of real value.

The exact action that counts as activation will be different for every product. It should be chosen carefully based on data that shows a strong link between completing that action and becoming a long-term user. Once defined, activation becomes one of the most important metrics for growth because it sits right at the start of the customer journey.
