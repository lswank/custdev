In QuickBite, a user is considered activated when they place and receive their first food delivery order within seven days of signing up. Simply downloading the app or browsing restaurants does not count. The user must go all the way through the process of choosing a restaurant, placing an order, and having that order successfully delivered to their door.

The seven-day window was chosen based on data showing that users who do not order within their first week are far less likely to ever become regular customers. This tight timeframe helps the team focus on what happens right after signup, such as onboarding prompts, first-order discounts, and restaurant recommendations, to push new users toward that critical first delivery.

Tracking this metric lets QuickBite measure how well its signup flow and early marketing efforts are working. If activation rates drop, the team knows to investigate whether something is broken in the ordering experience, whether restaurant selection is too limited in certain areas, or whether promotional offers need to be adjusted to encourage that first purchase.
