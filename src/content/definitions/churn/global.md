Churn is what happens when a customer stops using your product for a defined period of time. In subscription businesses, churn usually means the customer canceled their plan. In other products, churn is measured by how long someone has gone without taking a meaningful action. Either way, churn represents lost customers and lost revenue.

Churn rate is one of the most important metrics any company can track because it directly affects growth. If you are losing customers faster than you are gaining new ones, the business will shrink no matter how good your marketing is. Understanding why customers leave helps teams make better decisions about product improvements, pricing, and customer support.

Reducing churn often involves identifying warning signs before a customer actually leaves. These warning signs, sometimes called churn indicators, might include decreased usage, missed payments, or support complaints. By catching these signals early, teams can take action to re-engage customers and keep them around longer.
