A delivery radius is the geographic boundary within which a service can be provided to customers. It defines how far from a central point, such as a store, warehouse, or service provider, the company is willing or able to deliver its product. Anything outside this boundary is considered out of range and typically not served.

Setting the right delivery radius involves balancing customer demand with operational costs. A larger radius means more potential customers, but it also means longer travel times, higher delivery expenses, and greater risk of late or poor-quality deliveries. A smaller radius keeps costs down and quality high but limits the number of people who can be reached.

Companies often adjust their delivery radius based on factors like demand density, driver availability, and competitive pressure. In early stages, a tight radius helps a company learn and improve before expanding. Over time, as operations become more efficient, the radius can grow to cover new neighborhoods or regions.
