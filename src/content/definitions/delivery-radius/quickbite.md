In QuickBite, the delivery radius is defined as a five-mile circle around each partner restaurant for standard delivery orders. If a customer's address falls within five miles of a restaurant, that restaurant will appear as available in their app. Addresses outside this range will not see that restaurant listed unless they fall within range of another branch.

The five-mile limit was chosen based on early customer interviews, which revealed that food quality and delivery time are the two biggest concerns for users. Deliveries beyond five miles tend to take longer than 40 minutes, which leads to cold food and unhappy customers. Keeping the radius tight helps ensure that most orders arrive within a window that feels fast and fresh.

This radius is still a hypothesis and has not been fully validated with large-scale data. QuickBite plans to test different distances in select markets to see how expanding or shrinking the radius affects customer satisfaction, reorder rates, and delivery costs. The goal is to find the sweet spot where the company can serve the most customers without sacrificing the quality of the experience.
