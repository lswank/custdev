Order frequency measures how often a customer makes purchases within a given time period. It is usually expressed as the average number of orders per week, month, or quarter. This metric helps teams understand customer engagement and predict future revenue based on how regularly people are buying.

Higher order frequency generally means customers find consistent value in the product or service. It also tends to correlate with higher lifetime value, since frequent buyers spend more over time. Tracking order frequency across different customer segments can reveal which groups are most engaged and which might need encouragement to buy more often.

Teams use order frequency data to design loyalty programs, set promotional schedules, and forecast demand. If frequency drops for a segment, it can be an early warning sign of dissatisfaction or increased competition. A/B tests on features like reminders, discounts, and personalized recommendations are common ways to experiment with increasing this metric.
