In QuickBite, order frequency is defined as the average number of orders placed per active customer per month, with a target of three or more. An active customer is anyone who has placed at least one order in the past 60 days. This metric is one of the key indicators of whether QuickBite is becoming a regular habit for its users rather than an occasional convenience.

The target of three orders per month was set after A/B testing showed that customers who reach this level of usage are significantly more likely to remain active six months later. Below three orders, customers are still at risk of drifting away. The team runs experiments on push notifications, weekly deal emails, and in-app suggestions to nudge users toward ordering more frequently.

QuickBite breaks down order frequency by customer cohort, geography, and day of the week to find patterns. For example, customers in areas with more restaurant partners tend to order more often because they have more variety. These insights help the business development team prioritize which neighborhoods to expand into and which types of restaurants to recruit next.
