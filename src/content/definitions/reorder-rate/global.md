Reorder rate is the percentage of customers who come back to make a second purchase after their first one. It is a simple but powerful metric that shows whether the initial experience was good enough to bring someone back. A high reorder rate means customers liked what they got and want more. A low reorder rate suggests something went wrong the first time.

This metric is especially important for businesses that depend on repeat purchases rather than one-time sales. If most customers buy once and never return, the company has to keep spending heavily on acquiring new customers just to maintain revenue. A strong reorder rate means the business is building a base of returning customers who provide steady, predictable income.

Teams often run A/B tests to improve reorder rates by experimenting with follow-up emails, loyalty rewards, or second-purchase discounts. Even small improvements in reorder rate can have a large compounding effect on revenue over time, because each returning customer represents ongoing value rather than a one-time transaction.
