A support ticket is a tracked record of a customer issue that requires attention and resolution from the company's support team. When a customer reports a problem, asks a question, or files a complaint, a ticket is created to document the issue, assign it to the right person, and track it until it is resolved. Each ticket typically has a unique identifier, a status, and a history of all communications.

Support tickets are essential for maintaining organized and accountable customer service. Without a ticketing system, issues can fall through the cracks, customers can be left waiting without updates, and the team has no way to measure how well they are handling problems. Tickets provide a clear record that can be reviewed, escalated, and analyzed.

Beyond resolving individual issues, support ticket data is a goldmine for product improvement. By analyzing common ticket themes, teams can identify recurring problems that need to be fixed at the source. High ticket volumes around a specific feature often signal a usability issue or a bug. Tracking metrics like average resolution time and customer satisfaction after resolution helps the team continuously improve its support operations.
