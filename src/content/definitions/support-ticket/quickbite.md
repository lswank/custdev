In QuickBite, a support ticket is created any time a customer makes contact through the in-app help center or by calling the support phone line, and that contact results in a case ID being generated. This means every interaction, whether it is a question about a late delivery, a complaint about a wrong order, or a request for a refund, is formally tracked from start to finish.

The decision to track every contact as a ticket was made by leadership to ensure full visibility into customer issues. Before this policy, some contacts were handled informally and never logged, which made it impossible to understand the true volume and nature of customer problems. Now, every case ID links to a complete record of the issue, the customer's history, and the resolution.

QuickBite uses support ticket data to identify the most common problems customers face, such as missing items, late deliveries, or payment errors. This data is shared weekly with the product and operations teams so they can prioritize fixes. The company also tracks how long it takes to resolve tickets and how satisfied customers are with the outcome, using these numbers as key performance indicators for the support team.
