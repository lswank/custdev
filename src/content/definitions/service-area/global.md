A service area is the geographic region where a company actively operates and provides its product or service to customers. Unlike a delivery radius, which is measured from a single point, a service area describes the overall footprint of the business. It might cover a single city, a group of neighborhoods, or an entire country, depending on the company's scale.

Defining service areas carefully is important for setting customer expectations and managing operations. Customers inside the service area can expect full access to the product, while those outside may need to wait for expansion. Clear service area boundaries also help with marketing, since advertising is most effective when targeted at people who can actually use the service.

Expanding into new service areas is a major strategic decision. It requires investment in local operations, partnerships, and marketing. Companies typically use data on population density, demand signals, and competitive landscape to decide where to expand next. A well-chosen new service area can drive significant growth, while a poorly chosen one can drain resources without enough return.
