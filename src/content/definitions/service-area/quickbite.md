In QuickBite, a service area is defined as any metropolitan area where the company has 20 or more active partner restaurants. This threshold was established through analytics that showed customers in areas with fewer than 20 restaurant options have significantly lower satisfaction scores and higher churn rates. Without enough variety, the app does not feel useful enough to justify regular use.

The 20-restaurant minimum ensures that customers in a service area have a reasonable selection of cuisines, price points, and quality levels. It also provides enough supply-side density so that delivery times remain competitive. When QuickBite evaluates a new metro area for launch, the business development team works to sign at least 20 restaurants before the area goes live in the app.

QuickBite currently operates in a defined set of service areas and uses analytics to prioritize which new metros to enter next. The team looks at factors like population size, existing food delivery competition, restaurant density, and the cost of driver recruitment. Once a new service area reaches the 20-restaurant threshold and passes operational readiness checks, it is turned on in the app and marketing campaigns begin to drive customer awareness and signups.
