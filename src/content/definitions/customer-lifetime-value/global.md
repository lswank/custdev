Customer lifetime value, often shortened to CLV or LTV, is the total amount of revenue a company expects to earn from a single customer over the entire length of their relationship. It is not just what someone has spent so far, but a forward-looking estimate that takes into account how long they are likely to stay, how often they will buy, and how much they will spend each time.

CLV is one of the most important metrics in business because it tells you how much you can afford to spend to acquire a new customer. If the lifetime value of a customer is high, you can invest more in marketing and still come out ahead. If it is low, you need to either reduce acquisition costs or find ways to increase how much each customer spends over time.

Calculating CLV typically involves combining data on average purchase value, purchase frequency, and customer lifespan. More advanced models also factor in costs like support, returns, and discounts. The goal is to have a clear, data-driven number that guides decisions about budgets, product development, and customer retention strategies.
