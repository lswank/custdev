A partner restaurant is a business entity that provides food items through a platform. In the context of marketplaces and delivery services, the partner restaurant is the supply side of the equation. Without enough quality partners, the platform cannot offer the variety and convenience that attracts customers.

Managing partner relationships involves onboarding, quality standards, menu integration, and ongoing communication. The platform typically provides technology tools that help the restaurant receive orders, manage preparation times, and track performance. In return, the restaurant gains access to a larger customer base without needing to build its own delivery infrastructure.

The term "partner" is important because it signals a collaborative relationship rather than a simple vendor arrangement. Both sides depend on each other for success. The platform needs good restaurants to attract customers, and the restaurants need the platform to reach diners who prefer ordering through an app. This mutual dependence shapes how agreements are structured and how disputes are resolved.
