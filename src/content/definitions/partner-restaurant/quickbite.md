In QuickBite, a partner restaurant is defined as any restaurant that has a signed partnership agreement, has completed full menu integration into the QuickBite platform, and maintains a customer rating of 4.0 or above. All three conditions must be met for the restaurant to be listed as an active partner in the app. If the rating drops below 4.0, the restaurant enters a probation period.

The signed agreement covers commission rates, delivery expectations, food preparation time commitments, and dispute resolution procedures. Menu integration means that every item the restaurant offers through QuickBite has been entered into the system with accurate descriptions, prices, photos, and dietary information. This ensures a consistent and reliable experience for customers browsing the app.

The 4.0 rating requirement is an industry-standard quality gate that protects QuickBite's brand and customer trust. Restaurants that fall below this threshold receive feedback and support to improve. If they cannot raise their rating within 30 days, their listing may be paused. This system encourages restaurants to maintain high food quality and fast preparation times, which benefits everyone on the platform.
